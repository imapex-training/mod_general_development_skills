* Did you get what you expected?  Why not?   
* As we've written these functions, we've made some assumptions about how they will be used, and by whom.  We also should document those assumptions in the form of a test case(s).. We know we want to test a couple things.
	* The function works - 2 x 2 = 4 and 4 x 2 = 8
	* The function should receive an integer
	* The function should return an integer

* So let's get started. Python unittests is a common library used for testing, and the easiest to get started with.
