## Go do it exercise

* Create a bash script that does the following
	* Ask the user for their ***Spark Token*** 
	* Use that token to make an API call to Spark and get a list of their Spark Rooms.  Save the outputed JSON into a file.  Be sure to format the JSON in a pretty way.  
	* Search through the Saved file and create a new file containing the list of **roomIds**, and only the **roomIds**
	* Create a new file based on the full returned room JSON where all double quotes are replaced with single quotes.
