We'll create a new directory and walk through some basic Vagrant exercises.  

* Create the new directory, and initialize vagrant for the project 

	```
	mkdir imapex101vagrant
	cd imapex101vagrant
	vagrant init	centos/7
	
	A `Vagrantfile` has been placed in this directory. You are now
	ready to `vagrant up` your first virtual environment! Please read
	the comments in the Vagrantfile as well as documentation on
	`vagrantup.com` for more information on using Vagrant.
	```
