## Go do it Exercises 

* Take a look at the [hpreston/myhero_data](https://github.com/hpreston/myhero_data) repo and read through the README section on development environments.  
* Clone the repo locally and "vagrant up" the environment and try to interact with the microservice API.  
* Review the Vagrantfile and Vagrantfile.host and see if you can follow how they work together to provide a Docker environment with Vagrant
